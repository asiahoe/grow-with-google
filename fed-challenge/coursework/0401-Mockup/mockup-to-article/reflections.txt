Your response goes here!

* What new skills have you learned?
  - These skills are not new to me, although I did learn about some deprecated tags, like <strike>.
* What has been easy?
  - This has all been very easy for me.
* What has been difficult?
  - Going back and forth opening files in Chrome, which doesn't natively open local files, was annoying, so I ran a local server with Python.
* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
  - Research was a big thing for me. In my initial run learning HTML and CSS, the Mozilla Developer Network didn't exist yet, so my primary resource was a book. It's very nice to be able to search the network or the internet.

# Quiz: What Styles Are Applied?

Check out the sample site (`index.html`) in the Workspace. Your goal is to set the following media queries:

- Between 0 and 400 pixels, set the background color to **red**
- Between 401 and 599 pixels, set the background color to **green**
- 600 pixels or wider, set the background color to **blue**

Feel free to write your code in a text editor as well. You may open the page in your browser to test various viewport widths.

After completing this quiz, check out our own implementation (`solution.html`)!

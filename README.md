# Grow with Google

As part of their [Grow with Google](https://grow.google/) initiative, Google has partnered with [Udacity](https://udacity.com) to offer [25,000 Web Development scholarships](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google).

## Udacity Front-End Nanodegree

### Why Front-End?

In November of 2017, I applied for one of these scholarships. At the time I was uncertain about which track I wanted to pursue.

With the ubiquity of JavaScript, and the foundation I already had with front-end development and UX Design, I decided it would be most prudent to pursue their Front-End Development opportunity.

### Challenge Scholarship

Out of tens of thousands of applicants in the US, I was selected for 1 of 15,000 seats for the challenge scholarship.

This challenge scholarship lasted for 3 months, from January until April 2018.

### Full Scholarship

Out of 15,000 students, I was 1 of 1,500 selected for the scholarship to the full Front-End Developer nanodegree program.

The full scholarship will 6-months, from April until October 2018.

## About This Repository

This repository will be a living record of my experiences in the program. As I grow more advanced, I want to be able to look back at this old code and see how far I've come.
